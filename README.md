# Cyclistic_CaseStudy/DailyLog

#### Day 1 - Had a big problem to upload the data into BigQuery SandBox which led me to learn PostgreSQL and how to create tables on it.

- BigQuery is a cloud platform, slow, and unstable.
        
- Decided to use a different software (PostgreSQL).
          
- That's when I had time to think and perform some cleaning in my dataset before uploading it: created two new-columns, formated columns for consistency, and the length of the primary key (consistency, consistency, and consistency).
            
- My girlfriend (she is a data analyst) was so proud of me that she hand crafted a certificate for it.

#### Day 2 - Created my notebook on GitHub, this one that you are reading right now.

- Step-by-step of Phase 1 'ASK' and Phase 2 'PREPARE'

#### Day 3 - Trying to filter and analyze the data

- Observation: my first time analysing by myself
